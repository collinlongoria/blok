TODO (that I know of):

Refactor SVO rebuild into compute shader
SVO storing material index for PBR + color
obj loader and voxelizer
noise gen for world

incorporate Julia's imgui
shadow payload
optimize lighting (do this after PBR is implemented)
create non-pathtraced pipeline (raytraced, not using acceleration extension)

// NEXT 2 weeks:
SVGF spatial denoising
tone mapping
exposure control
bloom
TAA
motion blur?
