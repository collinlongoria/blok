TODO (that I know of):

Refactor SVO rebuild into compute shader
SVO storing material index for PBR + color
obj loader and voxelizer
noise gen for world
make push constant for raytracing that allows for random depth and such
incorporate Julia's imgui
shadow payload
optimize lighting (do this after PBR is implemented)
create non-pathtraced pipeline (raytraced, not using acceleration extension)

// NEXT 2 weeks:
SVGF spatial denoising
tone mapping
exposure control
bloom
TAA
motion blur?
