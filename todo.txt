TODO (that I know of):

Refactor SVO rebuild into compute shader
SVO storing material index for PBR + color
Denoising and accumulation
obj loader and voxelizer
noise gen for world
make push constant for raytracing that allows for random depth and such
incorporate julias imgui
shadow payload
optimize lighting (do this after PBR is implemented)
fix issue with reflective surfaces having visible edges
create non-pathtraced pipeline (raytraced, not using acceleration extension)
