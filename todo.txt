TODO (Collin)

// NEXT 2 weeks:
Bit-Brick leaves: turning leaf nodes into 4x4x4 blocks to improve performance
Send initial bounce to a compute shader, only use raytracing pipeline for continuing bounces (huge optimization i think)
consider implementing upscaling using FSR or DLSS?

// NEXT 2 weeks:
systems for registering block types
implement a list of lights, multiple lights and use emissives as emitters
noise gen for world

// NEXT 2 weeks:
Refactor SVO rebuild into compute shader?
obj loader and voxelizer

// LONG term:
bloom?
motion blur?
glass and refraction

// THE BIGGEST NEED:
One BLAS per chunk, multiple TLAS instances, and chunk LOD

// KNOWN ISSUES:
no way to disable camera movement

// SOME EXPLORATIONS TO CONSIDER:
mesh shader for SVO traversal -> triangulation -> greedy meshing (on gpu not possible maybe?)
just forgetting SVO and doing triangles (would work best withraytracing pipeline)
